            <div class="block1 content">
                I'm Mahim Vyas, a 19-year-old B.Tech student in my second year of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). I'm passionate about both technology and environmental sustainability. Recently, I completed an internship where I actively contributed to raising awareness about environmental issues, especially the importance of tree plantation in reducing pollution. This experience helped me understand the direct impact of collective action on the environment.

                In my academic journey, I'm currently focusing on subjects like Design and Analysis of Algorithms (CSE 301) and Digital Communication (CSE 2002), which fuel my interest in problem-solving and communication technologies. I enjoy exploring the latest technological innovations and frequently apply what I learn to assignments and projects. I also work efficiently with tools like my MacBook and Zsh shell, which have become essential to my workflow.

                In the future, I see myself diving deeper into fields like artificial intelligence, data science, and software development. I'm particularly fascinated by how AI and machine learning can be used to solve real-world problems, from healthcare to environmental sustainability. I want to explore innovative ways to merge technology with sustainability, contributing to solutions that not only advance technology but also help protect the environment.

            <div class="block4 content">
                I'm also interested in working on large-scale projects that have a meaningful impact, whether it's developing efficient algorithms or designing systems that enhance communication and connectivity. Ultimately, I want to use my skills to drive positive change, blending my love for tech with a commitment to making the world a better place.
